# Wiki-Speedrun-Bot

A bot that exhaustively searches all wiki links until it finds a target.
I am but a simple programmer and if anyone has tips and tricks for me on this project I'd love to see them!

**Procedure**

Starting by entering the start location that the bot will scan from.
The program is case sensitive, use the EXACT name in the wikipedia link. The bot will automatically add the *wikipedia.org/wiki*, all the user has to do is add the name of the wiki page.


Then enter the target site. Follow the same rules as the starting site.

The bot will then search every site on this site, and then every site on those sites, etc etc until the target is reached.


Eventually the bot should find the target and return to you the path that it took.
Keep in mind I made this very quick, with little to no optimization. It is slow, barely works, but it taught me alot by making it :D
