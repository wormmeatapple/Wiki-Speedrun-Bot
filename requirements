`pip install requests`
`pip install regex`
`pip install bs4`

Run these commands in cmd to gather the required packages. 
Time and collections are preinstalled so no need to gather them.
Then simply open a command prompt, navigate to the directory wikispeedrun.py is held and run `python wikispeedrun.py`.


(im not sure how to turn python scripts into executables yet, or if thats something thats even possbile.)
